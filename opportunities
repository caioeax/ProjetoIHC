  </summary>
  <div class="accordion-module__content">
    <p>The School of Art’s Communications Office is assembling our annual list of students interested in being placed on a call list to receive opportunities for small one-time design jobs and to produce email publication graphics. These one-time jobs are open to MFA students in all areas of study, and graphics can take any form as long as the requirements laid out in each job description are met.</p>

<p>When a new job becomes available, an email will go out to this call list with the job description, due date, and pay rate. Pay ranges from $75–$300 per job and images/materials must be submitted at the provided Dropbox link before payment is released. In the interest of fairness, the first student to respond to each job with their availability to produce the materials by the listed deadline will be hired—except in special cases for exceptionally big jobs, in which case we might ask for links to past work or an intended design concept before commissioning.</p>

<p>(A little more about how this list works: When you receive a commission, you’re removed from the call list for the remainder of the semester, and possibly the academic year depending on how many students sign up for this list / express interest in creating something for the School. Our goal is to make sure everyone who signs up is eventually commissioned!)</p>

<p>Reply to the email that will go out on August 26, or <a href="mailto:lindsey.mancini@yale.edu" target="_blank">email Assistant Director of Communications Lindsey Mancini</a> to join the All-School Graphics Call List at any point throughout the academic year if you’d like to be placed on this call list in the future.</p>

Call for Enrichment Proposals 2025</strong></span><br>
<br>
The Yale Pathways to Arts &amp; Humanities Summer Scholars program is a free, 2-week, on-campus summer program offered to local public high school students. Yale faculty, graduate students, and staff are invited to design and teach a one-off, 60-min enrichment in our summer program. We are seeking proposals that will spark students’ imaginations and extend their learning beyond the walls of their high school classrooms.<br>
<br>
The number of students will depend on the format of the session and instructor preference. Instructors can teach the same enrichment multiple times with different groups of students. Enrichments happen alongside 5-day workshops – both weeks, Monday through Thursday.<br>
<br>
Program Dates<br>
   Week 1: July 21 - 25 <br>
   Week 2: July 28 - Aug 1<br>
Enrichment Timeslots<br>
   11:20 AM - 12:20 PM<br>
   Monday - Thursday<br>
<br>
A bit about the students: Yale Pathways to Arts &amp; Humanities Summer Scholars are a diverse group of students from New Haven, West Haven, and Orange public schools in grades 10 through 12. Approximately half would be the first in their family to go to college.<br>

    <span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Yale Peabody Museum (YPM) invites student proposals for the Fall 2025 Student Exhibition</strong></span><br>
<br>
The Peabody Student Exhibition is a temporary exhibition that is curated, designed, and installed by Yale students. The upcoming iteration of the Student Exhibition will be on display in the designated Student Exhibition Gallery of the Peabody Museum from October 2025- March 2026. The Student Exhibition Gallery is a (~20’x30’) space adjacent to the Central Gallery of the Peabody. The room has a system for hanging 2D items on the walls, and a set of display cases of various sizes. We encourage students to think creatively about the use of this space, and, though not required, we welcome ideas about layout or design in their proposal. <br>
<br>
We invite exhibition proposals from individuals or pairs of students who are interested in developing, curating, and creating a museum exhibition. Proposals are welcome from both undergraduate and graduate students. Concepts need not be limited to topics in science—they can come from a variety of disciplines, though successful proposals will thoughtfully relate to the Peabody Museum and make use of Peabody collection objects and specimens.  <br>
<br>
The Peabody Museum houses over 14 million objects across 10 curatorial divisions. This iteration of the Student Exhibition will have the opportunity to work with the collections listed below. Though final selection of objects for display will depend on input from Peabody curators, collections managers, and conservators, we ask that applicants refer to the Peabody Collections online database to select a few sample objects that would support your concept.  <br>
<br>
Student curators will be compensated for their work and will be supported and advised throughout the exhibition process by YPM staff.  <br>
<br>
Collections:  
<ul>
    <li>Entomology  </li>
    <li>History of Science and Technology  </li>
    <li>Invertebrate Zoology  </li>
    <li>Vertebrate Paleontology  </li>
    <li>Invertebrate Paleontology  </li>
    <li>Paleobotany  </li>
    <li>Mineralogy and Meteoritics  </li>
    <li>Babylonian Collection  </li>
    <li>Botany  </li>
    <li>Ornithology and Mammalogy </li>
</ul>
Requirements: Submissions are limited to Yale students <br>
Student curators must be available to work on planning the exhibition over Summer 2025 and Fall 2025 <br>
Able to work part time over the summer and fall semesters <br>
<br>
To be considered, please submit proposals to <a href="mailto:peabody.student.programs@yale.edu" target="_blank"></a><a href="mailto:peabody.student.programs@yale.edu">peabody.student.programs@yale.edu</a> by <strong>April 25</strong>. Proposals should be submitted using the attached proposal form (<a href="https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/YSjJx5QhQQWMV1VZh0Po" target="_blank">download here</a>) and be no longer than 3 pages. If you have any questions, please contact <a href="mailto:natalie.mastick@yale.edu" target="_blank"></a><a href="mailto:natalie.mastick@yale.edu">natalie.mastick@yale.edu</a>.

    <span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Apply to be a 2024-25 Law, Ethics &amp; Animals Program Student Fellow!</strong></span><br>
<br>
The Law, Ethics &amp; Animals Program at Yale Law School (law.yale.edu/animals) is inviting applications for its 2024-25 LEAP Student Fellows Program. Applications are due on Wednesday, September 25. <br>
<br>
<strong>About LEAP:</strong><br>
Launched in 2019, the Law, Ethics &amp; Animals Program (LEAP) at Yale Law School is a multidisciplinary “think-and-do tank” dedicated to developing new strategies to address industrialized animal cruelty and its impacts on the living world, and to drawing attention to the questions of conscience and law raised by humanity’s treatment of animals. To this end, LEAP leads and coordinates a diverse program of activities that serve students and scholars at Yale and that contribute to defining, expanding, and advancing the field of animal law and policy. LEAP’s programming includes academic and experiential courses; the Climate Change and Animal Agriculture Litigation Initiative and other research initiatives; active support for student research projects and publications; and regular lectures, panels, and events. Learn more at our website: law.yale.edu/animals. <br>
<br>
<strong>About the LEAP Student Fellows Program: </strong><br>
Each academic year, LEAP selects a group of Student Fellows, including both Yale Law School students and other Yale graduate and professional school students. The goal of the Student Fellows Program is to support the academic and professional goals of Yale students interested in helping animals, to further empower these students to do impactful work while at Yale, and to build a robust and fun community of students and scholars interested in animal law and policy on campus.<br>
<br>
During the academic year, LEAP Student Fellows receive support from LEAP faculty and staff to work on a project related to animal law, policy, and ethics. The projects can take a myriad of forms, such as academic research (either with LEAP or independently); a policy proposal; submission of comments on proposed regulations; an op-ed or popular press article; or another research or creative project of the Fellow’s choosing. Credit or pay is available for some projects. LEAP Fellows shape and participate in the life of the LEAP program in a variety of ways, including helping to envision, organize, and advertise the events that LEAP hosts during the academic year. LEAP Fellows are asked, at minimum, to work on one project of their own choosing, to attend two LEAP events per semester, and to help spread the word about LEAP events and initiatives on campus. <br>
<br>
We welcome applications from all Yale graduate and professional school students. No past experience or expertise in animal law is necessary.<br>
<br>
To apply, please <a href="https://airtable.com/appLG4Kmn6Iwjz2pA/shrQdwX9ojqpZTFrk" target="_blank">complete this form</a> with a resume and brief statement of interest by <strong>WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 25</strong>. If you have questions about the fellowship or application process, please contact LEAP Postgraduate Fellow Laurie Sellars (<a href="mailto:laurie.sellars@yale.edu">laurie.sellars@yale.edu</a>).

    <span style="font-size:18px"><strong> Yale Ventures x CCAM Curatorial Fellowship</strong></span><br>
<br>
Yale Ventures, launched by Yale University in 2022, was created to connect and support the university’s innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem. We seek to build a vibrant entrepreneurship and innovation ecosystem that increases support, resources, and opportunities for Yale innovators—faculty and students—as they translate their ideas and discoveries into new ventures that will positively impact the world’s greatest challenges. Yale Ventures will open their new space at 101 College Street in October 2024. This 10,000-square-foot space will include flexible space for mission-related programming, as well as office spaces and conference rooms for Yale staff engaged in related projects.  <br>
<br>
The Yale Ventures x Yale CCAM Art + Innovation Fellowship offers a unique opportunity to activate the Yale Ventures headquarters by curating art that embodies Yale’s vibrant interdisciplinary community. This fellowship is designed for a Yale artist, technologist, and/or curator from any media and practice(s) or discipline who is passionate about the intersection of innovation and technology at the university.  <br>
<br>
The fellow will curate one or more works from among the Yale community and/or in the greater art world to inspire and engage visitors and community members in the space, leveraging these themes. The fellow will consult with the Yale Ventures and Yale CCAM teams to receive guidance on the creative and logistical aspects of the exhibition, with the goal of imagining new methods and augmenting existing practices of curatorial expression and engagement. The works, subject to approval by Yale Ventures and CCAM, will be displayed at the Yale Ventures headquarters at 101 College Street, timed to coincide with the opening of the new space.<br>
<br>
In addition to activating the Yale Ventures space, fellows will support Yale CCAM in the production of its Fall 2024 exhibition at its ISOVIST gallery, which opens on November 8, 2024. This may involve assisting the show curator with the installation of artworks, publications, and other duties as assigned.  <br>

    <span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Call for Participation: Yale Textile Working Group</strong></span><br>
<br>
This fall marks the beginning of a new interdisciplinary working group centered around textiles, sponsored by the Whitney Humanities Center. The group is intended to help Yale community members connect over the topic of textiles. Researchers, historians, makers and practitioners of all disciplines and expertise levels are all welcome!<br>
<br>
Meetings will serve as spaces to discuss the history and future of textile crafts in all dimensions, including techniques (weaving, embroidery, quilting, knitting, crochet, etc.), materials (cotton, silk, wool, synthetics, dyes, etc.), and practices (social histories, collectives, industries, sciences, local traditions, etc.) While the group can be called a working group in an academic sense, it is also intended in a more tangible sense: if you have handwork that you want to attend to in a communal setting, you are welcome to bring along works in progress. Working in community facilitates an alternative discussion space to the traditional academic forum, and some limited basic materials and tools will be supplied at meetings.<br>
<br>
Depending on interest, members will also be welcomed to join in on the Yale Farm’s indigo harvest and dye extraction process, which will occur until the first frost, and a mending workshop is also planned for the fall. <strong>To join the email list to be notified of meetings and textile-related happenings, or if you would like to propose a presentation of your research or practice during a meeting, please <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSezGYIhM-EqFYKamGcngQLHbecA26AE6nAyWz8CeJuGBMy19A/viewform" target="_blank">register HERE</a> and/or join our first introductory stitching circle on September 9 from 5-7pm in Loria 360 (on the community calendars!).</strong> Please pass along this announcement to any colleagues — faculty, student, or staff — who may be interested, regardless of department/school.

    <span style="font-size:18px"><strong>DHLab Fall Opportunities</strong></span><br>
 <br>
Are you a Yale graduate student interested in humanistic questions and in building professional experience and expertise on digital humanities projects in a client-facing role? The Yale DHLab welcomes applicants to our DH Generalist Consultant and DH Specialist Consultant positions. Generalist Consultants bring a broad interest in DH expertise and Specialist Consultants bring an existing area of knowledge they’d like to deepen. Consultants are funded to hold consultations in the DHLab (a minimum commitment of two hours per week) and, as interested, to join DHLab projects, participate in secondments to other library units, and train in relevant skill areas.<br>
 <br>
For more detailed information and to apply, please visit <a href="https://www.yalestudentjobs.org/" target="_blank">the student jobs portal.</a><br>
 <br>
<u><strong>WORKSHOPS</strong></u><br>
<strong>Skip a Thousand Words: Data Visualization Principles for DH</strong><br>
&gt; WHEN Wed Sep 18 10-11am<br>
&gt; WHERE online<br>
&gt; HOW <a href="https://yaleconnect.yale.edu/dhlab/rsvp_boot?id=2276544" target="_blank">register here</a><br>
&gt; WHAT: Struggling to express a pattern you’re noticing in your data? Just looking to add visual interest to your DH project? Try a data visualization! This workshop will expose you to principles and techniques that can help you make compelling data visualizations that effectively convey your work to viewers. Participants will walk away with a conceptual grounding in designing data visualizations; this workshop will not focus on conveying statistical significance or adhering to disciplinary standards in traditional data fields. No programming experience required.<br>
 <br>
<strong>DH Foundations </strong><br>
&gt; WHEN Wed Sep 25, Oct 2, Oct 9 2-3:30pm<br>
&gt; WHERE online<br>
&gt; HOW register for <a href="https://yaleconnect.yale.edu/dhlab/rsvp_boot?id=2276543" target="_blank">Part I</a>, <a href="https://yaleconnect.yale.edu/dhlab/rsvp_boot?id=2276541" target="_blank">Part II</a>, <a href="https://yaleconnect.yale.edu/dhlab/rsvp_boot?id=2276539" target="_blank">Part III</a><br>
&gt; WHAT: In this interactive online workshop, participants will explore many avenues for creating meaningful and ethical DH projects by critically discussing case studies of existing projects as a group. We’ll also discuss the history of DH as a field and practice while collaboratively creating vocabularies around what it even means to “do DH”— especially what it means to “do good DH” —and identifying important questions to ask along the way.<br>
<br>
Participants will work together to identify qualities essential to any effective DH project and will walk away with a shared vocabulary to critique and propose DH projects of their own. This workshop will involve a lot of working together, but we do not expect participants to bring existing knowledge of DH methods, programming, or technical skills in general.<br>
<br>
Note: This workshop is open to current Yale graduate students and postdocs and is the first requirement to complete the Digital Humanities Lab’s DH certificate. Participants must attend all three parts to receive credit.

<strong>Open Call for <em>Hypertext/Hyperlink</em> Exhibition, CCAM <em>ISOVIST</em> Gallery, Fall 2024: </strong>Hypertext has been a foundational concept in how the web operates, connecting relational pages through hyperlinks to create a constellation of interconnected documents. The term “hypertext” was coined by Theodor Nelson, who described it as “non-sequential writing – text that branches and allows choices to the reader.” This concept is evident in HTML (HyperText Markup Language), the markup language used for creating websites, where the anchor tag links HTML documents together. Curated by CCAM ISOVIST Guest Curator Alvin Ashiatey (Lecturer, Yale School of Art and MFA ‘22)<br>

    <span style="font-size:18px"><strong>University of New Haven seeks collaborators on interdisciplinary poetry project</strong></span><br>
<br>
The University of New Haven invites student artists specializing in painting and graphic illustration to participate in an exciting interdisciplinary project that merges the worlds of poetry and visual art. This unique initiative, led by fellow UNH instructor and award-winning poet, Lauren Crawford, centers around her debut poetry collection, which explores profound themes through vivid language and compelling narratives. The project seeks to bring these poems to life through original artworks created by talented visual artists, offering a powerful dialogue between word and image.<br>
<br>
Participating artists will be tasked with interpreting and creating a visual piece inspired by one of the poems from Lauren’s forthcoming collection, which will be featured in a virtual gallery on her author’s website as well as promotional material &amp; potential live exhibitions. This project not only provides a unique platform for artists to showcase their work alongside a published poetry collection but also introduces a philanthropic element: in exchange for student artwork, Lauren will make donations to charities chosen by the contributing artists. This approach fosters both artistic collaboration and community impact, providing artists with a meaningful opportunity to express their creativity while supporting causes they care about.<br>
<br>
This is a fantastic chance for student artists to gain exposure, collaborate across mediums, and be part of a project that bridges literature and visual art in a fresh and impactful way. Students who identify as women, LGBTQ, and Persons of Color/Indigenous are especially welcome to apply. Deadline for completed pieces is <strong>November 15, 2024</strong>. Interested students are encouraged to <a href="mailto:lcrawford@newhaven.edu" target="_blank">submit their portfolios or reach out for more information</a> on how to get involved in this creative and socially conscious endeavor.

“That will include the font, drawing out the animal in a certain style (examples will be provided), and designing the flavor of the shake. When we choose an individual for the project, I will share a word document containing the examples that we have made to showcase what exactly we are looking for in the project. In regards to the deadline of when the project is requested, It would be ideal to have the finished project done in two weeks. However, I do know that managing academics and a side project is difficult, and I will gratefully extend that deadline if need be. With payment, I will pay two hundred dollars and that will be open to negotiation. <br>
<br>
In regards to me choosing an individual to do this project, I would like to do a tiny interview process. This process could be done by having them email me copies of previous work, to ensure that the art style we are looking for matches theirs.”<br>

    <span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Low Season Artist Residency Program: Block Island, RI</strong></span><br>
<br>
The Low Season Artist Residency is one part dedicated time for creative research and one part community engagement. We have partnered with the Block Island School to provide workshops for students led by our residents. We are interested in artists willing to develop unique experiences for students at the Block Island School. Our artists also engage with the public to share their work through a community lecture or open studio-style event.<br>
<br>
While our residency does not have designated studio space, we offer free housing and breakfast at the Old Town Inn, a stipend for art-making and living expenses, and a small travel stipend to cover the Block Island Ferry. Materials for the Block Island School workshop are covered as well.<br>
<br>
Think of this as a DIY residency- one that is meant for artists who are willing to make art without a white cube studio. We encourage writing, reading, research, sketching, photography, exploring the often vacant beaches or miles of hiking trails, and working outdoors, or in the community spaces of the Old Town Inn. If you need a little bit of time away to regroup, reflect, and reimagine your path as an artist, this residency is for you!<br>
<br>
We are committed to creating a network of artists and critics through our program by providing professional development opportunities. Residents will get the chance to meet with one of our visiting critics for a virtual studio visit after their time on the island. This is a chance to reflect on your Low Season Residency and the trajectory of your work with an art world professional.<br>

    <span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Open Call: </strong><strong>Triple Canopy Publication Intensive</strong></span><br>
June 2–13, 2025<br>
<br>
<strong>What: </strong>The Publication Intensive is a two-week program in the history and contemporary practice of publication for recent college graduates, graduate students, and early-career practitioners. Triple Canopy’s editors and collaborators lead discussions and workshops with participants, who research, analyze, and develop projects that engage with contemporary technologies while mining the history of print culture and artistic practice. <br>
<br>
The program addresses such questions as: How have artists, writers, and technologists used publications as vehicles for material experimentation, political expression, and the cultivation of audiences? What defines a publication today, and how is that definition complicated by shifts in labor conditions, technologies, and readerships? How does publication drive efforts to organize people and test out new ideas? <br>
<br>
<strong>Where: </strong>The program will take place at Triple Canopy’s venue in Manhattan, and will include visits to publishers, archives, cultural institutions, and the studios of artists and designers.<br>
<br>
<strong>When:</strong> June 2–13, 2025. Sessions are held Monday–Friday, 10 a.m.–4 p.m. (with some variation).<br>
<br>
<strong>Cost: </strong>Tuition is free, though participants must arrange and cover their own travel and accommodations. All reading and viewing materials will be provided free of cost.<br>
<br>
<strong>Application:</strong> Apply online by Monday, March 24 at 6 p.m. Eastern. <a href="https://canopycanopycanopy.com/initiatives" target="_blank">Apply here &gt;</a>

    <span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Pioneering summer creative residencies within an inspiring mediterranean natural scenery in rural Greece</strong></span><br>
July / August 2025<br>
<br>
The PERIPLUS project is founded as a nonprofit organization to reveal and diffuse creativity’s power for the common good. Provoking change and positively affecting the present and future of individuals, social groups, businesses and institutions, through innovatively enhancing pre-existing potential and fostering local community regenerative motivation.<br>
<br>
The 2025 residencies’ program, Periplus* Workshops, offers the unique opportunity for emerging creatives to respond to nature in two small villages of rural Greece. In Arcadia,  the mythical land of pastoral utopia, in central Peloponnese or at the agricultural side of the historical Chania Region, in Crete. In a carefully structured period of intensive days, a determined group of participants use limited resources to create individual and collaborative responses, culminating in a local exhibition which is open to the wider local community and encourages an outward-facing conversation about the value of experimental creativity in context. <br>
 <br>
As well as learning from and working alongside local people, participants in Periplus Workshops foster sustainable development through skillsharing, introducing new approaches to problem solving and storytelling. At the same time, learning about the traditional forms of handicrafts and local material culture, they are looking for new ways of better preserving and innovatively including them. They take active part into giving the selected territories visibility as a living laboratory, open to new thinking capable of playing a key role in changing the social fabric and bring about new ways of doing and being.<br>

<br>
The School of Art &amp; Design at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign invites applications for a full-time, tenure-track faculty position, at the rank of Assistant or Associate Professor, to support the continued expansion of the program in Graphic Design and Design for Responsible Innovation. The School encourages submissions from individuals with specializations across a range of design areas. The anticipated start date is August 16, 2025.<br>
<br>
We seek applicants who will contribute to our faculty by pushing beyond graphic design’s historical perspectives and approaches to engage design’s ethical implications, re-center those excluded by the discipline, or innovate methodologies and pathways. These include, but are not limited to, Indigenous design knowledges, queering design, applied experimentation in visual communication, social interaction design, liberatory approaches to the development and dissemination of knowledge, collaboration across disciplines and with community partners, and design for climate justice and to dismantle and reimagine other inequities faced by historically marginalized communities.<br>
